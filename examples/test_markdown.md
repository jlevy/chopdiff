# Technical Documentation Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about our technical documentation system.
It covers everything from basic concepts to advanced features.

## Getting Started

Welcome to our documentation system.
This section will help you understand the fundamentals.

> **Note:** This is an important note in a blockquote.
> Make sure to read this carefully before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A text editor

- Basic knowledge of Markdown

- Access to our repository

You should also be familiar with version control systems.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the documentation tools:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

3. Run the setup script

The installation process typically takes 5-10 minutes.

#### Code Examples

Hereâ€™s how to install using different package managers:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g doc-tools

# Using yarn
yarn global add doc-tools

# Using pip
pip install doc-tools
```

Note that lines starting with `#` in the code block above are comments, not headers.

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for effective documentation.

### Document Structure

Every document should follow our standard structure:

- Clear hierarchy with headers

- Logical flow of information

- Consistent formatting

> Well-structured documents are easier to maintain and navigate.
> 
> This is especially true for large documentation projects.

### Style Guidelines

Our style guidelines ensure consistency across all documentation:

1. Use active voice

2. Keep sentences concise

3. Avoid jargon when possible

4. Include examples

Remember that clarity is more important than brevity.

#### Markdown Examples

Hereâ€™s some example markdown showing headers in different contexts:

```markdown
# This is not a real header (it's in a code block)
## Neither is this
### Or this

Regular text can contain # symbols without being headers.
```

Inline code can also contain `# hash symbols` without issues.

## Advanced Features

This section covers advanced features for power users.

### Templates

We provide several templates for common documentation types:

- API documentation

- User guides

- Technical specifications

- Release notes

Templates save time and ensure consistency.

#### Example Template

```yaml
# This is a YAML configuration file
# The # symbols here are YAML comments, not markdown headers
name: Documentation Template
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  - introduction
  - # This is a comment about sections
  - api_reference
  - examples
```

### Automation

Many documentation tasks can be automated:

1. Auto-generation from code comments

2. Link checking

3. Format validation

4. Spell checking

> **Pro tip:** Automation reduces errors and saves time.

#### Shell Script Example

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# This is a shell script
# These are shell comments, not markdown headers

echo "Building documentation..."
# Step 1: Clean old files
rm -rf ./build/*

# Step 2: Generate new docs
./generate-docs.sh

# Step 3: Deploy
./deploy.sh
```

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices for high-quality documentation.

### Review Process

All documentation should go through our review process:

1. **Self-review** - Check your own work

2. **Peer review** - Have a colleague review

3. **Technical review** - Subject matter expert review

4. **Final approval** - Manager or lead approval

The review process ensures accuracy and clarity.

### Maintenance

Documentation requires regular maintenance:

- Update for new features

- Fix broken links

- Improve clarity based on feedback

- Archive outdated content

> Set aside time each sprint for documentation maintenance.
> 
> Consider creating a documentation debt backlog.

#### Python Example with Comments

```python
# This is a Python script
# These comments should not be parsed as headers

def process_documentation():
    """Process markdown documentation files."""
    # Step 1: Read the file
    with open("doc.md", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Step 2: Parse headers
    # Note: We need to ignore # in code blocks
    headers = extract_headers(content)

    # Step 3: Generate TOC
    toc = generate_toc(headers)

    return toc

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the processor
    process_documentation()
```

### Tables

Hereâ€™s an example table:

| Feature | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-formatting | Automatically format markdown | âœ… Complete |
| Link checking | Verify all links work | âœ… Complete |
| Spell check | Check spelling errors | ðŸš§ In Progress |
| # Not a header | This is table content | âœ… Complete |

## FAQ

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use # in regular text?**

A: Yes, # symbols in regular text donâ€™t create headers.
Only # at the start of a line (with a space after) creates a header.

**Q: What about code blocks?**

A: Code blocks are completely isolated.
Any # symbols inside them are treated as literal text:

```
# This is inside a code block
## So these are not headers
### They're just text
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the documentation

2. Search existing issues

3. Ask in the community forum

4. File a bug report if needed

# Conclusion

Good documentation is essential for project success.
By following this guide, youâ€™ll create documentation that is clear, consistent, and
valuable to your users.

> **Remember:** Documentation is a living document that should evolve with your project.
